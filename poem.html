		<button class="poemTitleBlock"><strong>Be there for yourself </strong></button>
			<div class="blockPadding">
				<p>You cry during movie and hearing a sad song,<br>
					And support your friends when someone does them wrong.<br>
					Pity and kindness to strangers; understanding what they go through,<br>
					Save some up and spare some for yourself too.<br>
					<br>
					Don’t push too hard; at times give in to despair and cry.<br>
					Just as you owe yourself to live each day and try.<br>
					But when each attempt ends in one more closed door,<br>
					Cut yourself some slack and love yourself a little more.<br>
					<br>
					Look for joy, as if it were your holy grail,<br>
					Know exactly what you want and look for thrill.<br>
					Find people who set you free and fly higher than any bird,<br>
					See their actions beyond any careful web of word.<br>
					<br>
					Don’t be blind to things you lack, don’t stumble through internal war,<br>
					Know yourself, each small flaw and every scar,<br>
					Remember life as it is and consequences for every wrong deed you bore,<br>
					And count them up, so for each you can love yourself a little more.<br>

		<button class="poemTitleBlock"><strong>	Heavenly world </strong></button>
		<div class="blockPadding">
			<p>A minute to smile,<br>
				No complains to file,<br>
				How beautiful life would be?<br>
				In Earth heaven would be seen.<br>
				<br>
				No wars going on for self gain,<br>
				No selfishness or giving pain,<br>
				Extinction of every conservative bar,<br>
				And life twinkling like stars.<br>
				<br>
				Love among all people,<br>
				Peace among war loving fools,<br>
				A clean place to live,<br>
				True people with nothing to shrive.<br>
				<br>
				Forgiveness for any mistake,<br>
				Chain-free be every neck,<br>
				The god within worshiped and pleased,<br>
				True humanity would be achived.<br>
				<br>
				Banishment of all crimes,<br>
				Bringing up the real shine,<br>
				Feeling out shining diamonds and gold,<br>
				It would be a heavenly world.<br>
				<br>
				Experience from the old,<br>
				Young practice to be bold,<br>
				A place where souls aren’t sold,<br>
				For me it would be heavenly world.<br>

		<button class="poemTitleBlock"><strong>	Memories </strong></button>
		<div class="blockPadding">
			<p>I drew trees when I was eight.<br>
				A straight trunk branched into three branches,<br> 
				A cloud of leaves, undistinguished. <br>
				A wall of blue at the back, <br>
				Dotted by flocks of birds. <br>
				Praises made up for the lack of beauty;<br> 
				An eight year old Picasso creating wonders.<br> 
				<br>
				I can still see the picture in my head,<br> 
				Or the frame in the nightstand next to my bed,<br> 
				I am looking into it right now, <br>
				And I will it to transform somehow, <br>
				To the way, it was, the way it won’t be again,<br> 
				Then I see my reflection and will the same.<br>

			</p>

	<button class="poemTitleBlock"><strong>	The Summer Voyage </strong></button>
		<div class="blockPadding">
			<p>There once was a sunny and gloomy summer day,<br>
				And a ship sailed for it won’t lay at bay.<br>
				And maybe you were too good to not take along<br>
				But I wonder if leaving to you had felt all wrong.<br>
				<br>
				And all the buds you tended and seed you sow,<br>
				Grew into blossoms and covered your gardens in row.<br>
				Along grew weed and long and dancing grew the grass<br>
				Oh how wild and untended that spring was.<br>
				<br>
				Red and orange was world with leaves in stack,<br>
				The weather moved on without keeping track<br>
				Cold grew the wind and it was end for all to see,<br>
				For I knew a fallen leaf can never grace a tree.<br>
				<br>
				I cannot yet bid you farewell nor come along,<br>
				But maybe keep you updated thorough a seasonal song<br>
				For I am certain one winter you will come and knock<br>
				I shall be ready with our pairs of best fuzzy winter socks.<br>
			</p>

		<button class="poemTitleBlock"><strong>	Way I want to know you </strong></button>
		<div class="blockPadding">
			<p>I want a sense of you in the depth of my existence;<br>
				An image in my head, you lost in thoughts leaning into a fence. <br>
				Your laugh when I forget two failures and recommend the same book thrice<br> 
				And you still won’t read it and call it my weird vice.<br>
				<br>
				The way you like shades of purple all over your room,<br> 
				And reassurance u require when you are drenched in gloom.<br> 
				You sending screenshots of conversations that broke your heart<br> 
				And words u needed after to make you believe you are smart.<br>
				<br>
				A little yelp of surprise that sometimes escapes your lips,<br> 
				And how self conscious you get while I wait for next time it slips.<br> 
				You telling about your happiest memories with a sigh, <br>
				These are the moments I want to remember you by. <br>
				<br>
				Maybe i will forget jumbles of names and place, <br>
				And every time I repeat your jokes I will make a mess,<br> 
				But deep in my soul I will see you as clear as any hue, <br>
				And that’s the way I want to know you.<br>

		<button class="poemTitleBlock"><strong>	Where I am from </strong></button>
		<div class="blockPadding">
			<p>I am from Kathmandu,<br>
				the land of valleys.<br>
				From the cramped and old homes<br>
				painted in a landscape of green.<br>
				(Places whose name changes<br>
				with shifts in the ruling government)<br>
				I am from the soil<br>
				where I slip every year during monsoon.<br>
				I am from the land of blood and sweat loss<br>
				but not the land that absorbed it<br>
				(Because it was sent abroad and exchanged for lack of hunger)<br>
				From the land of few shining cars<br>
				but not a single good road to drive them in.<br>
				I am from the playground<br>
				set up for Dashain<br>
				(with swing which creaked every time you went too high.)<br>
				From the dry room at the top of the quiet home<br>
				that was comfortingly filled with piles of rice.<br>
				(which smelled of hard work when cooked.)<br>
				I am from the tall old apple tree<br>
				that was chopped down after everyone in the house fell from it<br>
				But not before it gave scars to remind me of it.<br>

		<button class="poemTitleBlock"><strong>	World without light </strong></button>
		<div class="blockPadding">
			<p>Sun, moon, stars, bulbs and candles we own,<br>
				With light we see mountains and materials in each cell of our bone,<br>
				One looks up from the surface plain and looks down from height,<br>
				But believe me when I say this is a world without light.<br>
				 <br>
				Prejudice we use as a stick to lead us through our way,<br>
				Injustice here has hurt many people every day,<br>
				With ray of hope some live through hell,<br>
				But the darkness’s strong arm suffocates hope as well.<br>
				 <br>
				A few here stands to show that courage is still here,<br>
				But the changes courage can bring are among the worst of our fear,<br>
				So we act too busy following our conservative historic line,<br>
				And we are blind towards true heroism’s shine.<br>
				 <br>
				Instead of innocence we see colour and race,<br>
				Other people’s suffering cannot change our pace,<br>
				But how can we be blind? Isn’t our world perfect and right?<br>
				So, maybe we live in a world without light.<br>
